Basic tutorial
==============

The [glu](http://pongasoft.github.io/glu/docs/latest/html/index.html) documentation contains a [basic tutorial](http://pongasoft.github.io/glu/docs/latest/html/tutorial.html) which will walk you step by step through the main features of glu.

This tutorial installs and deploys everything locally on your machine. Through this tutorial you will deploy several webapps in 3 different webapp containers, view log files, run commands, use the cli, etc...

Note that this tutorial requires a unix like platform and java 1.7 to run. The entire tutorial/glu distribution is self contained in a folder and does not _pollute_ your machine: after you are done you can simply delete the folder.
